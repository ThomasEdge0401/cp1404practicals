# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I would usually over estimate. But I would usually be an hour or two within my estimate.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It didn't change, it was always an over estimation of 1-2 hours.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that giving myself a time frame to work against made me work a lot faster to beat it.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I've only been reviewed by two people, I received a "Good Work" from one and some constructive feedback about my naming conventions on the other. So the only thing I've learned from this is how to improve my naming conventions.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

The only thing I would change is to make the deliverables section more specific, in this prac I wasn't sure how you wanted the URL for the original flask project delivered, so I creted a whole new repository for it and am still not sure if this was how you wanted it delivered.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I wrote clean, test-first, single-responsibility code in small iterations. I applied the same habits across console tasks, classes, file I/O, Kivy, and Flask. Also the structure and overall cleanliness of my code I feel I did well in
