# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually set aside an hour or two after work to try and watch them all in one go.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I'm watching ALL of the lecture material so that I can fully understand, as well as knowledge from Programming 1 gave me a head start. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop leaving these pracs to the last minute, I feel myself rushing to submit before the due date.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Work keeps overlapping with the one online class I have. I joined the Week 1 class, but this week I missed it due to work.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I feel like my structuring has improved and I found it simple to refactor my past programs from the previous prac.
