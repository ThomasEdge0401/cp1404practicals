# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I’ve been breaking problems into smaller steps earlier and focusing more on writing clean, structured code instead of rushing straight to the solution.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to start practicals earlier instead of leaving them close to the deadline so I have more time for review and feedback.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’m following coding conventions well, writing clear functions, and using classes appropriately. I’m also asking for help from friends when I get stuck instead of wasting too much time.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop rushing through practicals just to get them done. Instead, I should focus on fully understanding it so I can apply them properly in future work.
## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would like more examples of completed practicals to compare my work against, so I can understand what’s expected more clearly.
